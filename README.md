# SCDevelopment
Data and codes for our paper "Mapping the spatiotemporal continuum of structural connectivity development across the human connectome in youth". 
The original data for these analyses are available via the NIMH Data Archive (NDA),  [the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development, (ABCD)](https://nda.nih.gov/abcd), [the Lifespan Human Connectome Project in Development (HCP-D)](https://nda.nih.gov/ccf), the Science Data Bank [the developmental component of the Chinese Color Nest Project, (devCCNP)](https://doi.org/10.57760/sciencedb.07478), and the [HBN-POD2](https://github.com/nrdg/HBN-POD2). Data of the YEN and SAND are not yet available, as collection is still ongoing.

## demopath
This folder contains the demographic, cognitive, and psychopathological characteristics of the participants in the ABCD and HCP-D datasets. `DemodfScreenFinal.csv` is for the ABCD dataset. `HCPD_demo_behav.csv` is for the HCP-D dataset. The codes for organizing these data frames are located in `/development_script/1st_dataclean/merge_demography_info_and_screen`.

## wd
This folder contains statistical magnitudes, data for visualization and derivatives derived from the analyses. It has four sub-folders:
* [interdataFolder_ABCD](https://github.com/XiaoyuXu750/SCDevelopment/tree/main/wd/interdataFolder_ABCD) : Statistical magnitudes derived from general additive mixed models (GAMM) or general additive models (GAM) fitted to the ABCD dataset.
* [interdataFolder_HCPD](https://github.com/XiaoyuXu750/SCDevelopment/tree/main/wd/interdataFolder_HCPD) : Statistical magnitudes derived from GAM fitted to the HCP-D dataset. 
* [results_ABCD](https://github.com/XiaoyuXu750/SCDevelopment/tree/main/wd/results_ABCD) : Derivatives and posterior derivatives of developmental GAMM fitted to the ABCD datasets, including correlation coefficients with posterior derivatives at 1,000 specific age points within the age span.
* [results_HCPD](https://github.com/XiaoyuXu750/SCDevelopment/tree/main/wd/results_HCPD) : Derivatives and posterior derivatives of developmental GAM fitted in the HCP-D datasets, including correlation coefficients with posterior derivatives at 1,000 specific age points within the age span.

## development_script
This folder contains codes for all the analyses in the manuscript and the sensitivity analyses in the supplementary materials.

* The [1st_dataclean](https://github.com/XiaoyuXu750/SCDevelopment/tree/main/development_script/1st_dataclean) folder contains codes to extract the structural connectivity (SC) strength of large-scale SC matrices and conduct ComBat analyses.
* The [2nd_fitdevelopmentalmodel](https://github.com/XiaoyuXu750/SCDevelopment/tree/main/development_script/2nd_fitdevelopmentalmodel) folder contains codes to fit GAM or GAMM to evaluate developmental effects and compare the spatial patterns with the sensorimotor-association (S-A) connectional axis.
* The [3rd_plotConnectionalAxis](https://github.com/XiaoyuXu750/SCDevelopment/tree/main/development_script/3rd_plotConnectionalAxis) folder contains codes to visualize the S-A connectional axis and S-A cortical axis.
* The [4th_changerate_SAcorr](https://github.com/XiaoyuXu750/SCDevelopment/tree/main/development_script/4th_changerate_SAcorr) folder contains codes designed for age-resolved developmental analyses and separate analyses within datasets partitioned based on the age threshold where the alignment of developmental effects undergoes a reversal.
* The [5th_cognition](https://github.com/XiaoyuXu750/SCDevelopment/tree/main/development_script/5th_cognition) folder contains codes to conduct cognitive analyses.
* The [6th_pfactor](https://github.com/XiaoyuXu750/SCDevelopment/tree/main/development_script/6th_pfactor) folder contains codes to conduct psychopathological analyses.

See the `README` in each folder for details of individual scripts.

## gamfunction
This folder contains functions called in the analyses. The functions called in the scripts in the `development_script` folder can be found here.
