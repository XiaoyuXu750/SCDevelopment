# 3rd_plotConnectionalAxis
This folder contains codes to generate `dlable` file of the sensorimotor-association (S-A) cortical axis with the `BuRd` color and visualize the S-A connectional axis.

## 1st_plotConnectionalAxis.R
This script visualized the S-A connectional axis (`Fig. 3A`).

## S2nd_generate12fractionSAsurfaceRdBu.m
This script generated a `dlable` file of the S-A cortical axis with the `BuRd` color. The `dlable` file is then visualized by `connectome workbench`.
